// DN-41 `width_cast` conversion-body emission (M-873 follow-on).
//

// `width_cast(value: Binary{N}, into: Binary{M}) -> Binary{M}`: widen (M>N) zero-extends
// (`Exact`); same-width is identity; narrow (M<N) is a checked, never-silent refuse
// (`EvalError::Overflow`) — §3 fixes the **width-witness ABI**: `M` is carried by the *second
// operand's* `Binary{M}` width alone (its bits are unused), exactly as `lib/std/text.myc`'s own
// `width_cast(i, bytes_len(b))` call threads a width through an in-scope `Binary{32}` value.
//
// A Rust `impl Widen<To> for From { fn widen(self) -> To { To::from(self) } }` body — the actual
// shape in `mycelium-std-cmp` — has no confirmed mapping for the qualified `To::from(self)` call
// (see `emit_expr`'s `Expr::Call` qualified-path arm); previously that always gapped the whole
// impl. When `From`/`To` both map to `Binary{N}`/`Binary{M}` (unsigned widening), this is now a
// **real, faithful** emission instead: `width_cast(self, <Binary{M} witness>)`. The witness is a
// synthesized all-zero `BinLit` of exactly `M` bits — confirmed as a legitimate `Binary{M}`-typed
// value by the grammar (`literal ::= BinLit | ...`, `BinLit ::= '0b' ('0'|'1'|'_')+`) and
// RFC-0020 §"Representation-tagged literals" ("[a BinLit's] width/dimension is determined by the
// literal's content (bit-count for BinLit)") — and DN-41 §3 explicitly says the witness's *bits*
// are ignored, so an all-zero witness is exactly as valid as any other same-width value already
// in scope. This is a synthesized witness, not one reused from the call site (the widen body has
// no other `Binary{M}` value in scope to reuse) — `Declared`, not `Exact`, because no Mycelium
// checker in this crate confirms the emitted text type-checks (see module docs).
//
// `Narrow::narrow` bodies are the DN-41 §2 fallible case (`Result<To, NarrowError>`, refusing on
// an out-of-range/non-representable value) — a single `= expr` `fn_item` body has no
// Result-returning surface in this grammar fragment, so those stay an honest, explicitly-cited
// gap rather than a forced/fabricated emission.

// DN-125 (M-1081) — value-threaded `&mut self`/`&mut T` method/fn bodies.
//
// A mutating body's threaded binding(s) (`self` and/or a `&mut T` param, see `map_signature`) are
// rebound via NESTED `let <name> = <new-value> in <rest>` shadowing — Mycelium's own lexical
// scoping then implements DN-125 §5.2's sequential rebind (`x = h(x); …; x = k(x)`) for free: each
// later statement's occurrences of `<name>` resolve to the nearest enclosing `let`, i.e. the most
// recently threaded value, exactly mirroring Rust's own sequential in-place mutation.
//
// Deliberately NARROW (DN-125 §6.1 — never guess on an unprovable/aliased shape): only a FLAT
// sequence of `self.<field> (=|+=|-=|..) <rhs>;` / `*<param> (=|+=|-=|..) <rhs>;` re-assignment
// statements is recognized, optionally followed by one trailing value expression when the
// method's original return type carried an extra value. This transpiler has no DN-33 static
// uniqueness analysis to consult (that analysis is itself `Declared`/unbuilt, DN-125 §5.3) — so
// the "conservative confident-uniqueness check" §6.1 calls for is implemented by EXCLUSION: any
// body shape outside this flat sequence (control flow, an early return, a call chaining another
// mutation) is refused outright rather than risked.
//
// **Correction (re-review of PR #1527, closing an aliasing hole this doc previously claimed shut
// by construction):** the flat-sequence grammar DOES admit a plain `let <name> = <rhs>;`
// statement, and this emitter's `try_threaded_assign`/`threaded_deref_lhs` matching is purely
// name-based (it has no scope-tracking), so a `let` whose RHS is a bare reference to a DIFFERENT
// threaded `&mut` binding genuinely DOES introduce a second live alias to the shadowed name — a
// prior version of this doc's claim that this could not happen was wrong (see
// `crates/mycelium-transpile/src/tests/mut_thread.rs`'s
// `let_binding_aliasing_another_threaded_param_refuses_rather_than_mis_thread` for the repro).
// The REAL guarantee this module upholds is narrower: every body it DOES accept is provably safe
// to rebind because `aliased_threaded_binding` explicitly detects and REFUSES exactly this one
// aliasing shape (a bare-path `let <threaded-name> = <other-threaded-name>;`) before it can reach
// the fold — the narrowness of what we accept, now correctly including this exclusion, is what
// keeps every accepted body provably safe to rebind (never-silent G2/VR-5). An ordinary
// independent-value shadow (`let y = <literal>;`, `let y = *other;`, `let y = some_call();`, …)
// remains fully supported via the pre-existing synthetic-carrier routing.

    //   actually contains/imports the type (DN-113's cross-nodule resolution, out of this

    //   visibility marker to translate FROM, and this transpiler never emits `priv` on anything it
    //   produces — `reserved.rs`'s `"priv"` entry is only a keyword-collision guard, not a
    //   seal-tracking mechanism). So there is no first-class "sealed ctor" signal to check here;
    //   the seal's construction-side enforcement is, today, entirely SUBSUMED by the cross-nodule

// ---- DN-122 §13 (M-1080; WU-A) — the MVP foreign-trait-impl rule-swap ----------------------------
//
// **Verify-first (mitigation #14): there is no "synthetic-trait-def" code path in this crate to
// retire.** DN-34 §8.8 records that a per-file *fabricated* `trait Widen { … }` was tried and
// FAILED (`unknown Self` / arg mismatch / identity fork) — but that attempt was never committed
// here; `emit_impl` has always emitted a trait-impl's methods without ever emitting (or attempting
// to emit) a companion trait declaration for a foreign trait. So there is nothing to delete; this
// increment only ADDS the MVP-recognition path below (a smallest-auditable-step reading of "retire
// the failed synthetic-trait-def path for this class" — VR-5, stated rather than silently assumed).
//
// **What this actually changes.** Per DN-122's ratified OQ-6 (§13.2 WU-B): the MVP's target traits
// are **prelude-seeded** (`crates/mycelium-l1/src/ord3.rs`, mirroring `Fuse`/M-965) — ambiently
// available in every checked phylum, so an eligible impl needs **no `use` at all** (exactly how
// `impl Fuse[T] for T` already needs none; DN-122 §13.1: "the transpiler emits the impl against the
// ambient prelude trait — zero new checker work"). `emit_impl`'s per-method emission loop is
// unchanged either way (it already resolves `Self`/the impl's own type correctly, and already
// naturally supports the receiverless, param-typed methods this MVP class uses); this recognizer's
// only two jobs are: (1) tell an MVP-eligible impl apart from every other trait-impl shape, so (2)
// the emitted `impl` line carries the trait's Mycelium type argument (`[<SelfTy>]`) that Rust's own
// zero-explicit-arg `impl Ord3 for T` source never spells out (Mycelium's stage-1 trait model has no
// implicit `Self` slot — RFC-0019 §4.1 — the `T`-for-`T` idiom `Fuse` already established). A shape
// that does NOT match a registered prelude trait is left **entirely unchanged** — still emitted
// exactly as before WU-A landed (an honest, never-fabricated `myc check`-time residual tracked by
// M-876/M-1076, e.g. every `Widen`/`Narrow`/`MycEq`/`MycOrd`/`MycPartialOrd` impl in the corpus,
// all of which are `Self`-receiver-based and so are correctly excluded below).

/// One prelude trait's checked shape, mirroring its `crates/mycelium-l1/src/<name>.rs` hand-built
/// [`TraitInfo`](../../mycelium_l1/checkty/struct.TraitInfo.html) **exactly** — this is the emitter's
/// half of the T-A3 "emit iff check would accept" agreement (`tests/vet.rs`'s live-oracle probes the
/// other half). Every field here must match the seeded trait 1:1; a mismatch would either wrongly
/// refuse an eligible impl (safe — falls to the honest, unchanged path) or, far worse, wrongly emit
/// a `use`-free `impl` the checker then refuses (never allowed to happen — the shared-case-table unit
/// test in `src/tests/emit.rs` pins agreement against the real registry, not a re-typed copy).
