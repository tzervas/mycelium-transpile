//! The gap-close-2 **cross-nodule symbol table** (the `Import` gap-class lever — Phase-0 re-measure,
//! `docs/notes/DN-34-Rust-to-Mycelium-Transpiler-Strategy.md` §8.19/§8.20): a **batch-scoped** map
//! from a Rust crate-root-relative module path to the Mycelium nodule this transpiler derived for
//! it, plus the set of item names that sibling's own pass actually **emitted** — never a name that
//! merely exists in the Rust source but itself gapped. See `batch.rs::transpile_batch`'s two-pass
//! driver for how this is built and installed, and `transpile::dispatch_use` for the consumer.
//!
//! **M-1084 (Import net-close): `self::`/`super::` relative resolution + cross-PHYLUM resolution.**
//! The original gap-close-2 lever resolved only `crate::<mod>...` (crate-root-absolute) and the
//! bare crate-root form (`use <mod>::Item;` — real Rust "uniform paths": an unqualified `use` head
//! is *always* tried crate-root-relative first, in every file, not just the crate-root one). This
//! increment closes the two residuals that lever's own doc named as scoped out:
//! 1. **`self::`/`super::`** now resolve relative to the CURRENT file's own module path
//!    ([`use_candidates`]'s `current_module` parameter) — [`HeadKind::SameCrate`], always looked up
//!    in the current file's own crate, never tried as an extern-crate name. Multi-level `super::`
//!    chains (`super::super::X`, two directories up) are peeled one level at a time. A `super::`
//!    chain that would walk past the crate root is a genuine structural miss — real Rust itself
//!    rejects this — never a guess (VR-5/G2).
//! 2. **Cross-phylum**: a *bare* head (neither `crate`/`self`/`super`) is ambiguous in real Rust
//!    between "this crate's own crate-root submodule" and "an extern crate's own name" —
//!    [`HeadKind::Bare`]. **The real rule is root-file-only lexical shadowing, NOT "same-crate
//!    first everywhere"**: a bare `use foo::X;` resolves against a local item literally named
//!    `foo` in the CURRENT FILE's own lexical scope before falling back to the extern prelude, and
//!    a crate-root `mod foo;` is only ever a name in the CRATE-ROOT file's own scope — a non-root
//!    file never implicitly sees the crate root's sibling `mod` declarations. So
//!    [`SymbolTable::candidate_lookup_keys`] tries the same-crate key FIRST **only when
//!    `current_module` is empty** (this file itself is the crate root — matching real Rust's own
//!    crate-root shadowing); for every OTHER file, the same-crate key is never tried at all —
//!    only the head read literally as the named sibling PHYLUM's own extern-crate identifier
//!    (`transpile::derive_crate_ident`, the standard Cargo package-name -> crate-identifier
//!    mapping) is. A hit requires the exact crate identifier AND the exact emitted name to both be
//!    real entries in this batch's table (never a guess — VR-5); this only ever fires when the
//!    referenced phylum's own files are *in the same batch* (e.g. a multi-crate `--files`
//!    invocation) — a phylum transpiled in a wholly separate run is, honestly, still an
//!    out-of-batch miss (G2). This mirrors `crates/mycelium-l1/src/checkty.rs`'s DN-113
//!    `merge_phyla_exports`: "one added qualifier dimension" lets the SAME resolver handle both the
//!    intra-crate and cross-phylum case, no second resolver (DRY; DN-113 §9.6).
//!
//! Still scoped OUT (unchanged): a rename (the alias would need threading through every downstream
//! reference in the file body — out of this transpiler's rewrite surface) and a glob (no
//! disambiguation strategy yet — mirrors DN-113 v1's own deferral to M-982). Every miss — an
//! out-of-batch head, an in-batch sibling that itself gapped the requested name, a `self`-module-
//! binding leaf, a rename, a glob, or a `super::` with no parent to go up to — is still recorded as
//! a [`crate::gap::Category::Import`] [`crate::gap::GapReason`] naming exactly what could not
//! resolve and why (never silently dropped).
//!
//! **No bare-name collapse (the M-1060 lesson):** a resolved leaf is always emitted against the
//! sibling's *derived, home-qualified* nodule path (`use <nodule_path>.<Item>;`), never a bare
//! `<Item>` — the identical discipline `crates/mycelium-l1/src/checkty.rs`'s DN-113
//! `qualify_cross_phylum`/`merge_phyla_exports` use for the kernel's own cross-phylum resolution.
